# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard
# This project is an interactive dashboard that visualizes the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dashboard allows users to explore the dataset using interactive charts and displays demographic information for selected test subjects.

# Project Structure
# The project folder contains the following files and directories:

# 1. index.html
# This is the main HTML file for the dashboard. It includes the structure and layout of the page. It also links to the necessary JavaScript libraries and the app.js script located in the static/js folder.

# 2. README.md
# This file provides an overview and documentation for the project. It explains the purpose of the project, the folder structure, and instructions for setting up and running the application.

# 3. samples.json
# The samples.json file contains the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. It includes:

# names: A list of sample IDs.
# metadata: Demographic information for each test subject.
# samples: Microbial data for each sample ID, including otu_ids, otu_labels, and sample_values.

# 4. static/js/app.js
# The app.js file contains the JavaScript code for creating the interactive charts and handling user interactions. It uses the D3.js library to fetch data from samples.json and the Plotly.js library to render the visualizations.
